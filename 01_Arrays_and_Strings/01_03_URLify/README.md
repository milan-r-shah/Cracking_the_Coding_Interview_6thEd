### CtCI 6th Ed | Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

#### Problem 1.3: URLify

**URLfiy:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string <br>
has sufficient space at that end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" <br>
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can <br>
perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>  "Mr John Smith ", 13
<b>Output:</b> "Mr%20John%20Smith"
</pre>

*Hints: #53, #118*
